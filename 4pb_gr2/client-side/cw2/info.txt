Between the 1890s and 1940s, the Imperial Japanese Navy 
built a series of battleships as it expanded its fleet. 
Previously, the Empire of Japan had acquired a few ironclad 
warships from foreign builders, although it had adopted the 
Jeune École naval doctrine which emphasized cheap 
torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive, 
heavily armored ships. Combat experience in the First Sino-Japanese 
War of 1894–1895 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy 
that its doctrine was untenable, leading to a ten-year naval 
construction program that called for a total of six battleships and 
six armored cruisers (the Six-Six Fleet). 
To counter reinforcement of the Russian Empire's Pacific Squadron 
as tensions rose between the Russians and the Japanese over control of 
Korea and Manchuria in the early 1900s, Japan ordered the two 
battleships of the Katori 
class in 1903.
